# SMCE-gd ![CI](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Official frontend for [libSMCE](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE) using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).  
Initially created to emulate cars supporting the [smartcar_shield](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield) platform.

### Dependencies

* _[Godot](https://godotengine.org)_
* *_[libSMCE](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE)_ ([version](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L28))
* _[godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp)_ (automatically built from source; *_SConstruct_ is **not** used, but _Python3_ is still required)
* C++20-compatible compiler + _[CMake](https://cmake.org)_

### Prerequisites

1. [Setup](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki) (follow the setup for your OS)
2. [Releases](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE/releases) (extract/install the artifact for your OS, Windows users
should download the Release version)
3. Set the env var `SMCE_ROOT` pointed to the root of the extracted directory.
4. Restart the computer to make sure the env var gets applied.

### Building

```shell
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target godot-smce
```

Packaging is done using _CPack_.  
_note: we bundle the shared lib of SMCE on export_

### Running

* `godot --path project/`
* Or open up the project folder in the _Godot editor_ and start from there.
