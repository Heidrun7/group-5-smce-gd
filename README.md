# SMCE-gd ![CI](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Official frontend for [libSMCE](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE) using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).  
Initially created to emulate cars supporting the [smartcar_shield](https://github.com/platisd/smartcar_shield) platform.

### Dependencies

* _[Godot](https://godotengine.org)_
* *_[libSMCE](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE)_ ([version](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L28))
* _[godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp)_ (automatically built from source; *_SConstruct_ is **not** used, but _Python3_ is still required)
* C++20-compatible compiler + _[CMake](https://cmake.org)_

### Prerequisites

1. **Setup** (follow the setup for: [Windows](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/Windows-setup) / [MacOS](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/MacOS-setup) / [Debian-based GNU/Linux](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/Debian-based-Linux-setup))
2. [libSMCE Releases](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE/releases) (extract/install the artifact for your OS, Windows users should get the *Release* version)
3. Set the env var `SMCE_ROOT` pointed to the root of the extracted *libSMCE directory* (from step 2)
4. Restart the computer to make sure the env var gets applied

### Building on Windows

```shell
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Post-building steps on Windows

1. Copy the file `SMCE.dll` from *\build* to *\project\gdnative\lib*
2. Open the terminal and write `godot` to launch the godot editor
   1. Press "Import" and chose the file `project.godot` in *\project*
   2. Launch the project (this needs to be done at least once for the program to work when writing `godot --path project/`)

### Building on MacOS

```shell
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target godot-smce
```

Packaging is done using _CPack_.  
_note: we bundle the shared lib of SMCE on export_

### Running

* `godot --path project/`
* Or open up the project folder in the _Godot editor_ and start from there.
